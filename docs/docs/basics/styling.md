# Styling

To adjust colors for today date circle, you can pass style prop to Kalend like this:
    
    <Kalend
      style={{
        primaryColor: 'indigo',
        baseColor: '#3d3c3c',
        inverseBaseColor: '#f2ecec',
      }}
    />

For now, Kalend does not support further style settings, but you can adjust css class names used in components.
